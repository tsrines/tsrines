Hey there, I'm Tim.

After a successful career at [Cellular Sales](https://www.cellularsales.com) and real estate investing, my focus has shifted back to my hobby, the internet. I was tired of **chasing** and wanted to start **building**. It had been a while since I wrote any code, so in October of 2019 I decided to leave my job and move to NYC to accelerate my learning by attending Flatiron School's Immersive Software Engineering Program.

I am actively searching for the right opportunity at a company who could use a tenacious problem solver and lifelong learner with a keen business sense.  This could be in Charleston, SC, NYC, or remote.

So if you would like to reach out and discuss potential roles in your company, shoot me an <a href = "mailto: tim@rines.io">email</a> or  connect with me on <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/rines/">LinkedIn</a>.
